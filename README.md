A library for computing near optimal solution to large instances of the TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem) fast using a local solver. The library is written in C++ and provides Python bindings.

# Quickstart

First install the library

```bash
$ pip install fast-tsp
```


Then run the problem on your 2D distance matrix:

```python
import fast_tsp
dists = [
    [ 0, 63, 72, 70],
    [63,  0, 57, 53],
    [72, 57,  0,  4],
    [70, 53,  4,  0],
]
tour = fast_tsp.find_tour(dists)
print(tour)  # [0, 1, 3, 2]
```
